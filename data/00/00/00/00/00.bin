  |   The two jello jelly creatures Bismo and Plom got connected in a       |
  |   tragic yet funny accident and thus can exchange their size and        |
  |   abilities at will. Welcome to the world of Shift Happens - the only   |
  |   game out there which doesn't take a closer look at the body mass      |
  |   index and where players are actually forced to work together (and     |
  |   occasionally stab each other in the back).                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Experience thrilling adventures in four totally different worlds:.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Explore a freaked out laboratory where Bismo and Plom had their     |
  |     accident!                                                           |
  |                                                                         |

  |   - ... and survive the dry canyons where a deadly wind awaits you..    |
  |                                                                         |

  |   The twist: Shift Happens is pure fun for solo players, yet its full   |
  |   potential can only be experienced together. Play it with your best    |
  |   friend while hanging around on a couch enjoying a pizza. Together     |
  |   you can solve puzzles and fight over precious coins. Coordination     |
  |   and communication are key to a successful journey. We recommend       |
  |   using gamepads for maximum enjoyability.                              |

  |   The game also features a singleplayer mode with different level       |
  |   content. Although the game is primarily meant to be played by two     |
  |   people, you can play the completely different singleplayer levels     |
